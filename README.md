**Home Assistant Support for the GoControl Model GC-TBZ48 Z-Wave Plus Thermostat**

Based on work by briodan  at https://github.com/briodan/Thermostat_scheduler

Base thermostat work by briodan was sufficient but I want better control of setting heating/cooling set points.

Future work includes adding better remote sensor tempature control, seasonal settings, and support for using external tempature settings.
